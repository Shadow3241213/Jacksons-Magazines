Welcome to my mod!

***What Does Jackson's Magazines Do?***

Currently Only adds mixed tracer magazines with every 2 and 4 rounds being a tracer. This mod only adds magazines and can be used with weapons that utilize 3CB and RHS magazines. This mod is only compatible with GreenMag allowing easy repacking whenever needed!

***Future Plans***

Addition of more mixed tracer magazines is the goal allowing more weapons to have mixed tracer magazines
